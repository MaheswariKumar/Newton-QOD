Problem Statement
Newton has a sequence of N words. He wants to make sure that all the words after the first word follow a specific pattern i. e. they should start with letter same as the previous word ending letter and they should not have occurred before.

You are given all the words, tell whether they follow the pattern set by Newton or not. Print "Yes" if they follow, otherwise print "No"

N = int(input())
stack = []

for i in range(N):
    s = str(input())
    if len(stack) > 0:
        if s not in stack:
            w = stack[-1]
            if w[-1] == s[0]:
                stack.append(s)
            else:
                break
        else:
            break
    else:
        stack.append(s)

if len(stack) == N:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
